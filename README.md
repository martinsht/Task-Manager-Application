Task-Manager-Application:
The purpose of this project is to create a simple task application code. In the app, the user can only add, view the tasks, mark them as complete and make a list of the tasks that have to be done today. 
I have used three classes: A main; task class where I store my variables; task_manager class where I manipulate the variables. 
The code uses a do-while loop to run the menu and a switch-case statement for the different features of the task app. 
I created my code on IntelliJ IDEA compiler. 
It is created in java language.
